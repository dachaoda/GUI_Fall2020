Part 2 Reading
        Summary:
        The articles is really eye opening. I have learned that full-stacked developer 
        are basically jack of all trade, you don't have be a master in them all to become
        a full-stack developer. The road to full-stacked can be divided into two distinct 
        learning environments; front end and back end development. Front end development has 
        categories such understanding internet website functionalities, web development, and testing.
        The web development learning objective can be fulfilled by learning HTML and css to 
        design and create a website. Next we can learning javascript in order to add functionalities
        to websites and provided more complex design than HTML can provide. And lastly learning 
        HTML works and how to properly test websites using tools such Chrome DevTools.
        Alternatively, back end focus more on background functionalities such as database, 
        encryption/security, and organization of data structures. Fulfilling back end learning
        objective to become a full-stack developer is harder due to the fact it rely on more
        understanding of the system rather than learning a system. First is database, this require
        understanding in data relation and how to implement it in systems like SQL. Second is encryption, 
        this requires the developer to have a understanding in implementing security the accessibility of 
        it's background functions and data. Lastly data structures, this is a understanding in a manner of 
        work organization. Whether it is using git to better version your code, or splitting function to avoid
        potential bug when a dependency fails. At the end of the day, becoming a full-stack developer requires
        a mass amount of knowledge in varies topic, but it will also provided the ability to be adaptable to any 
        type of web development that might be required.

Part 3 Installing Atom
        Instead of using atom, I choose to install and use Visual Studio Code.
