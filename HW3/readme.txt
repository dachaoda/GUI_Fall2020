Part 1 Style a Site with External CSS
    The grident is a bit deceiving to the eye, but the grident only occur for 80%
    of the page where the last 20% at the bottom is a solid color.
    The css layout is done using grid in order for header's width
    to dynamically adjust to content's width, and nav'height to adjust
    to the combine height of footer with content. Any color used in
    the website with except to the provided color are based on the closest 
    hexdecimal vaules I can identify using color picker in photoshop.
