Bootstrap Enhancement
    The HW2 index page is recontructed from the ground up using bootstrap only. The included CSS
file was used for testing purpose only and contain no css that is relevent to the new page.
The following are major bootstrap feature changes included in the webpage page starting from top to bottom.
    
    Home page:

    1. Sticky navbar that follows the user down the page. The navbar also contain a menu and dropdown
    links to completed Assignment. Clicking the brand icon in the nav will also bring you back to the 
    Home page

    2. Corusel that displays a slide show of pervious works done in this class with caption labeling
    their respective assignment name.

    3. Button controlled collapsable summary for each assignment so far. From A1- A4 features sing target
    activition, but "ALL" targets all summarys and can expand and collapse all summaries at once. A4 
    also comes with a bootstrap bagde for indication this is the newest assignment.

    About_me page:

    4. Bubble img that features bootstrap border radius for rounding img htmls

    5. Table of contacts that list a number of ways to contact me 

    In General:
        The entire site is layout using bootstrap grid system. All color, spacing, font-weight, alignment 
    are done completly using bootstrap solution with the only exception being font-sizes for paragraphs.

Note: mobile testing is done using mobiletest.me for HTC ONE, Apple Iphone 5, and as small as my broswer can get.
